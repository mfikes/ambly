# Ambly

A [ClojureScript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript) REPL into embedded JavaScriptCore on iOS, OS X, and tvOS.

Ambly is a REPL designed for use when developing hybrid ClojureScript / native apps.

Ambly comprises a ClojureScript REPL implementation, along with Objective-C code interfacing JavaScriptCore.

An iOS and tvOS demo app is included, making it easy to give the REPL a spin.

```
pod "Ambly", "~> 1.1.0"

## Running

### Prerequisites

You must have Xcode installed as well as support for [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). 
You must have Java 7 or later installed along with [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org) or [Boot](http://boot-clj.com/).

### Demo App

In `ambly/ObjectiveC/Ambly Demo` run `pod install`.

Open `Ambly Demo.xcworkspace` in Xcode and run the app in the simulator or on a device.

### REPL

You can start the Ambly REPL by supplying `-re ambly` as an option to `cljs.main`.

Here is a sample REPL startup sequence in `ambly/Clojure`, illustrating device auto-discovery:

```
$ clj -m cljs.main -re ambly 

[1] Ambly Demo on iPod touch
[2] Ambly Demo on iPad
[3] Ambly Demo on iPhone Simulator (My-Mac-Pro)
[4] Ambly Demo TV on Apple TV

[R] Refresh

Choice: 1

Connecting to Ambly Demo on iPod touch ...

To quit, type: :cljs/quit
cljs.user=> (+ 3 4)
7
```

> Note: See [Connectivity](https://github.com/mfikes/ambly/wiki/Connectivity) for details, should any networking difficulty arise.

## App Integration

See [Integrating Ambly into Your App](https://github.com/mfikes/ambly/wiki/Integrating-Ambly-into-Your-App) for details.

An example using Ambly to drive Ejecta is at [ClojureScript Ejecta](http://blog.fikesfarm.com/posts/2017-04-29-clojurescript-ejecta.html).

Source for an example iOS app that makes use of Ambly is [Shrimp](https://github.com/mfikes/shrimp).
